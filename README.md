# GBS examples
Tiny source code of proper [GBS](http://ocremix.org/info/GBS_Format_Specification) files for posterity.

### Hyper Lode Runner
Since the game is quite small it posed some challenge I gladly accepted (no generic sound engine occupying whole bank). :) Other versions floating around don't initialize itself properly and have too much obsolete data included. Prime example of how not to do it. My version has everything in tact, so enjoy it if you can. 

### Itchy & Scratchy - Miniature Golf Madness
Similar as above but no one did it, so.. here it is.

### Battleship
This one uses timer interrupt. Version floating around doesn't have it defined, so it plays everything wrong. Hence I've added it here.

BTW, I don't use [rgbasm](https://github.com/rednex/rgbds), so these sources won't assemble without few changes.
