# Hyper Lode Runner GBS example
Tiny source code of proper [GBS](http://ocremix.org/info/GBS_Format_Specification) file for posterity. Since the game is quite small it posed some challenge I gladly accepted (no generic sound engine occupying whole bank). :) Other versions floating around don't initialize itself properly and have too much obsolete data included. Prime example of how not to do it. My version has everything in tact, so enjoy it if you can. Also, I don't use [rgbasm](https://github.com/rednex/rgbds), so this source won't assemble without few changes.
